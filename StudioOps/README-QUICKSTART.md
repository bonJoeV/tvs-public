# StudioOps Dashboard - Quick Start

## ⚡ Simplest Way (No Server Required)

**Just open this file directly:**
```
dashboard.html
```

### How to Open:
- **Windows**: Double-click `dashboard.html`
- **Mac**: Double-click `dashboard.html` or `open dashboard.html`
- **Linux**: Double-click `dashboard.html` or `xdg-open dashboard.html`

That's it! The dashboard will open in your default browser and work perfectly offline.

## ✅ What Works Without a Server

- ✅ All dashboard features
- ✅ Upload CSV/ZIP files from your computer
- ✅ All charts and visualizations
- ✅ All filters and tabs
- ✅ Export data to CSV
- ✅ Settings and configuration
- ✅ Complete offline functionality

The **only** things that won't work:
- ❌ The modular version (index.html) - requires server due to ES6 modules

## 📁 Which File to Use

| File | Needs Server? | When to Use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **dashboard.html** | ❌ NO | ⭐ **Use this!** Works everywhere, no setup |
| index.html | ✅ YES | Only if you're doing development work |
| start.html | ❌ NO | Helps you choose which version to use |

## 🎯 Recommendation

**99% of the time, just use dashboard.html**

Only use the server/modular version if you're:
- Actively developing/modifying the code
- Need faster browser caching for repeated loads
- Deploying to a production web server

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can:
1. Copy `dashboard.html` to any computer
2. Double-click to open
3. Upload your data files
4. Analyze your business

No installation, no server, no complexity!
